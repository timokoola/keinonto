# Python Schema-Driven Development Rules
# Applies to: *.py

This project follows schema-driven development practices using Pydantic.

## Data Schemas
- All data structures must be defined using Pydantic models
- Place schema definitions in the `schemas/` directory
- Include type hints and field validations
- Use descriptive field names with docstrings

## Code Organization
- Follow the project structure:
  ```
  project_root/
  ├── schemas/          # Pydantic models
  ├── api/              # API endpoints
  ├── services/         # Business logic
  ├── repositories/     # Data access
  ├── tests/           # Test suites
  └── utils/           # Helpers
  ```

## Testing
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use pytest for testing
- Include schema validation tests
- Write integration tests
